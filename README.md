# Neural-Networks-and-Handwriting-Recognition
In this project, I implemented a neural network and used it to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST image dataset. I implemented Radial Basis Functions in the neural network's hidden layer and used the network to predict which numeric digit 0-9 contained in test images presented to the network.
